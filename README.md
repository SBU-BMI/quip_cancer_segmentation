# quip_cancer_segmentation

This repo is for training and testing brca cancer detection pipeline using 3 standard CNNs: VGG16, Resnet-34, and Inception-v4. 
More details are found in the paper: [Utilizing Automated Breast Cancer Detection to Identify Spatial Distributions of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Invasive Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10841)

NOTE: download the trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1km7gVpBpLbBovExTgt3CE8JRwpTEl57F), extract 3 *.t7  files to data/models_cnn

The default settings are for Resnet-34 since it performs the best on the public testset. To use other models, change the variable "MODEL" in conf/variables.sh to other models name downloaded from google drive above.

# Dependencies

 - [Pytorch 0.4.0](http://pytorch.org/)
 - Torchvision 0.2.0
 - cv2 (3.4.1)
 - [Openslide 1.1.1](https://openslide.org/api/python/)
 - [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 - [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html)
 
 More details are in file brca_environ.txt

# Running Codes Instrucstions
- Codes are in folder scripts, including training and testing
- Need to setup folder path for training data, model. All parameters are found in conf/variables.sh
## Training:
- Settings are stored in conf/variables.sh
- Change DATA_PATH to your folder that contains all subfolders for training
- Change DATA_LIST to your text file name that contains list of subfolders for training and validataion. 1st line is for validation, the rest is for training. Example of the list is tumor_data_list_toy.txt 
- Run "bash train.sh" in folder "scripts"
- Log files are in data/log
- Trained models are in "checkpoint"

## Testing
#### Preparation:
- Change MODEL in conf/variables.sh to your model name that is stored in data/models_cnn
- Copy all .svs files to data/svs
  + For example, cd to your data/svs, run "cp /data01/shared/hanle/svs_tcga_seer_brca/TCGA-3C-AALI-01Z-00-DX2.svs ."
#### Process .svs files:
- Patch extraction: "nohup bash patch_extraction_cancer_40X/start.sh &"
  + For demo, cd to your data/patches, run "cp -r /data10/shared/hanle/quip_cancer_segmentation/data/patches/TCGA-E2-A152-01Z-00-DX1.svs ." which is a completed extraction of a slide.
- Prediction: ssh to computational node, run "nohup bash prediction/start.sh &"
- Copy heatmap files: "nohup bash heatmap_gen/start.sh &"
  + Output are in data/heatmap_txt
#### Generate Grayscale heatmap: 
  + Run "bash download_heatmap/get_grayscale_heatmaps/start.sh"
  + Results are stored at download_heatmap/get_grayscale_heatmaps/grayscale_heatmaps and data/grayscale_heatmaps
#### Confirm the results:
  + Compare the grayscale heatmap with the one on website: [https://mathbiol.github.io/tcgatil/](https://mathbiol.github.io/tcgatil/)


# Docker Instructions 

A Docker image is available at: [pytorch docker](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/hanle/brca-pipeline-image)
## Step 1:
Create folder named "data" and subfoders below:

- change the BASE_DIR setting in conf/variables.sh to the path of your working directory
- data/svs: to contains *.svs files
- data/training_data: to contain training data
- data/patches: to contain output from patch extraction
- data/log: to contain log files
- data/heatmap_txt: to contain prediction output

## Step 2:
- Run "bash create_container.sh" to create container for the docker
- Run "bash start_interactive_bash.sh" to start the docker workspace
- Clone codes from this repository to workspace of docker.
- run: "mv quip_cancer_segmentation/* ."
- Follow instructions for Training and Testing as below.
